Part One:
Compile and run SymmetricPascalMatrix.java
As prompted, enter the .dat file for LU Decomp into the console/terminal
As prompted, enter the .dat file for Householder into the console/terminal
As prompted, enter the .dat file for Givens into the console/terminal
As prompted, enter the .dat file for the augmented matrix to solve Ax=b using both LU and QR methods
After you enter the previous .dat file, it will also run Px=b for all pascal matricies 2 through 12 so make sure to scroll up to see all of the  previous results

Part Two:
Compile and run ConvergenceIterativeMethods.java
All results will be displayed in console/terminal

Part Three:
Upon compiling and running Power.java, a .txt file named 'answers' will be created and filled up
Answers contains the original matrix, number of iterations, extreme eigenvalue, extreme eigen vector, trace, determinant, and margain of error for each of the 1000
randomly generated 2x2 matricies with values between [-2,2].
It will then print out what the destination of this file is to the console.
After this you will be prompted to type the name of a .dat file.
Upon entering the name it will solve run the power method 100 times with margain of error .00005 and print out the results
